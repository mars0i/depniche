> Propositions come in two varieties: those that are purely
mathematical, relying only on our definitions of concepts, and
those that are facts about the world. Theorem provers like Lean
are concerned with the former category, and have nothing to say
about the flight capabilities of penguins or the legal status of
cities.

> Our logic has only to do with mathematical propositions; the
question whether it admits any applications outside mathematics
does not concern us here.
