DepNichePair.lean is the clearest set of experiments.

Depniche.lean and Depniche?.lean are earlier experiments.

DepnicheKyleMiller is from a response to a question I asked in
the Lean Zulip chat, and DepnicheKMscratch.lean is almost the
same thing.  These illustrate how to do something like DepNichePair
using Lean structure datatypes.  I think there were typos or
misunderstandings in what Kyle Miller wrote (very nice of him to do it),
and DepnicheStruct?.lean are (failed) attempts to rethink the idea.

(HelloVect.lean and StructureExamples.lean aren't about niche
construction at all; they contain little examples for the sake of
understanding some basic syntactic and semantical points about
lean.)
