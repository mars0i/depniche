-- I think I need an And operator here, and then And three Dec‚â°'s together?


-- ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED: When there are multiple dunlins in an env
-- that are engaged in niche construction, do they make changes to the
-- env sequentially or in parallel?  Can one dunlin's effect accidentally
-- undo another's?  Maybe niche construction should be understood as a
-- collective effect of all dunlins in a given env.  But that the function
-- that calculates this update to the env could be very complex.
-- An alternative is to treat envs as microenvironments, s.t. each is
-- occupied by only a single dunlin.  However, in that case we need to
-- allow the possibility that changes in envs will bleed over to nearby envs.
