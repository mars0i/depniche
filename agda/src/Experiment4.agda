  A speculative story I'm making up based on a couple of articles
  about dunlins or related birds: Depending on shape of beak,
  dunlins disturb mud more or less, which affects growth of small organisms
  that dunlins feed on or that become part of their gut microbiome.

  Is the following compatible with the structure in Callan's code in
  Niche.agda?  I think so.

  Every dunlin has an environment, identified by an environment id number.

  Every environment contains zero or more dunlins.

  Think of environment id numbers as simplified locations. At a given
  location, only one environment type is possible.  However, the type
  at that location can change.

  By contrast, dunlins have id numbers because every organism is unique.

  (Another environment difference that could be included is near-forest
  vs. far-from-forest.  Or maybe near-foliage, etc.  A dunlin can "construct"
  such an environment by choosing to build its nest there.  These differences
  can effect the probability of predation and protection from wind.)

-- ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED: When there are multiple dunlins in an env
-- that are engaged in niche construction, do they make changes to the
-- env sequentially or in parallel?  Can one dunlin's effect accidentally
-- undo another's?  Maybe niche construction should be understood as a
-- collective effect of all dunlins in a given env.  But that the function
-- that calculates this update to the env could be very complex.
-- An alternative is to treat envs as microenvironments, s.t. each is
-- occupied by only a single dunlin.  However, in that case we need to
-- allow the possibility that changes in envs will bleed over to nearby envs.
